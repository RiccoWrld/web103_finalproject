## 🧩 About

### 📝 Description and Purpose
HabitHero is a fullstack web app that helps users build and track positive habits through small daily goals.  
Each completed habit helps the user’s “hero” grow stronger, motivating consistency and self-improvement.  
The app allows users to add, edit, and delete habits, view progress, and earn virtual achievements for streaks.

### 💡 Inspiration
We were inspired by apps like **Habitica** and **Duolingo** that combine productivity with fun.  
Many people struggle to stay consistent, so we wanted to create something that makes tracking habits more engaging — turning discipline into a game.
