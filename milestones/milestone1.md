## Reflection

1. What went well during this unit?
👉🏾 We brainstormed and agreed quickly on a clear idea — HabitHero — a productivity and motivation app that helps users build daily habits. Our group collaborated well to define the main features, roles, and responsibilities. Everyone contributed ideas for the user stories and feature list.

2. What were some challenges your group faced in this unit?
👉🏾 It was a bit hard to narrow down which features to include since there are so many possible ideas for a habit tracker. We also had to make sure all required baseline features fit naturally into the project. Setting up the shared GitHub repo and assigning tasks clearly took some coordination time.

3. What additional support will you need in upcoming units as you continue to work on your final project?
👉🏾 We may need extra help with database relationships (especially many-to-many) and setting up deployment on Render. Some of us also want guidance on connecting the backend API with React efficiently.
